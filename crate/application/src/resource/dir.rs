//! Constants for resource directories.

// Note to self:
//
// I know in code we use the singular form of the noun, whereas the directory names are plural.
// This is in line with Amethyst's convention of resource directories.

/// `assets` directory name.
pub const ASSETS: &str = "assets";
/// `resources` directory name.
pub const RESOURCES: &str = "resources";
